description: Brief thoughts about the evolution of web design
---

Iâ€™ve been playing around a lot with CSS Grid these days and Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how much more we can do with web-based layouts now because of it. 

When I first started out developing websites, I worked closely with a designer who created absolutely beautiful layouts that definitely pushed the bounds of what CSS was capable of; they often resembled magazine spreads more than traditional website design at the time. But I realize now, with the introduction of grid, layouts like that are definitely possible to create with no responsive drawbacks.

It made me realize how our web tools probably dictated the evolution of web design, and not, as Iâ€™d always assumed, the other way around.
