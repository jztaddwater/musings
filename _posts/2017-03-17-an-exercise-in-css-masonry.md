If you're like me, you're pretty obsessed with  [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/){:target="_blank"}.

It‚Äôs been my go-to spot for inspiration, whether it be for recipes, design, fashion, or hedgies. One of the reasons I love browsing Pinterest is due to how elegantly their UI implements the *Masonry layout*, offering a pleasant viewing experience of a large amount of images. In fact, Pinterest so popularized the use of this layout that it‚Äôs also known as the ‚ÄúPinterest style layout‚Äù.

_A masonry of hedgies!!! üòç_

Masonry layouts have been around a long time. But they‚Äôre still one of the most effective ways of laying out a gallery, a portfolio, a dashboard, or any grouping of times.  Masonry, at it‚Äôs core, is a grid-based layout with rows containing items of variable heights. However, as these dynamically sized items wrap and stack on top of each other, they leave no unnecessary gap between the items. While simple in theory (‚Äúmaybe we can just use floats?‚Äù), CSS does not make this easy to implement.

Using floats will not reduce the spaces between differently sized items. Instead you will end up with something along the lines of this:

_eh‚Ä¶no_

So today I‚Äôm going to explore two pure CSS methods I‚Äôve found useful in implementing the Masonry layout.

## CSS multi-columns
The [CSS multi-column layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts){:target="_blank"} was first introduced with CSS3 to allow for breaking a block of text into multiple columns, giving readers a more newspaper-like reading experience. 

<p data-height="420" data-theme-id="28441" data-slug-hash="a6aaaed6a7ad7aeeddbea3dc1b2f5350" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ramenhog" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Column Count Layout" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/ramenhog/pen/a6aaaed6a7ad7aeeddbea3dc1b2f5350/">Column Count Layout</a> by Stephanie (<a href="http://codepen.io/ramenhog">@ramenhog</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

We can use two of these classes to get the masonry effect we want. 

First, our HTML will be structured like so:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="masonry">
  <div class="item">
    <div class="item__content">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <div class="item__content">
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- more items -->
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

The div with class `.masonry` will serve as the main container for all the different sized items. 

{% highlight css %}
.masonry {
  column-count: 5;
  column-gap: 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

`Column count` is used for dictating the number of columns you want to appear in your layout. In this case, we're creating a masonry layout with five columns, so we're simply setting that property to five.  The browser will then automatically set the maximum column height for each column so that they are all roughly equal in height.

We are also setting `column-gap` to 0, which controls the amount of space between columns, but _not_ rows. So, instead of dictating that space on each column, we‚Äôll actually let the `.item` element take care of that with it‚Äôs own padding. These `.item` elements actually act as a container to control the spacing between elements. This way the spacing all around each item will stay consistent without any funky wrapping.

{% highlight css %}
.item {
  break-inside: avoid;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 10px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

It‚Äôs also very important to add `break-inside: avoid` to the items making up the masonry. Since multi-column layouts were first created with breaking blocks of text into separate columns in mind, without this class, the content blocks may break and span across columns. Not ideal.

Now we can proceed to style the actual `.item-content`.

{% highlight css %}
.item__content {
    background: purple;
}
{% endhighlight %}

In my humble opinion, this multi-column method for achieving the masonry effect is the *most flexible and forgiving* method and is [partially or completely supported in all modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=column){:target="_blank"}. 

It is also very easy to make our masonry layout responsive with the multi-column method. To implement responsiveness with a mobile-first mindset, we can simply change the `column-count` property on the `.masonry` container based on viewport size.  As the viewport increases in size, the more columns we‚Äôll want our masonry layout to have.

{% highlight css %}
.masonry {
  column-count: 1; // one column on mobile
}
@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .masonry {
    column-count: 2; // two columns on larger phones
  }
}
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .masonry {
    column-count: 3; // three columns on...you get it
  }
}
<!-- etc. -->
{% endhighlight %}

You can see this in action in a little CodePen I put together here:

<p data-height="383" data-theme-id="28441" data-slug-hash="dvZVda" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ramenhog" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Responsive Pure CSS Masonry Layout - Column Count" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/ramenhog/pen/dvZVda/">Responsive Pure CSS Masonry Layout - Column Count</a> by Stephanie (<a href="http://codepen.io/ramenhog">@ramenhog</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

Still, I know even after all the ‚Äúmulti-column-for-masonry!‚Äù propaganda I‚Äôve spouted at you, you‚Äôre probably still wondering: ‚Äúbut what about FLEXBOX?!?!‚Äù Welp.

## Flexbox-based masonry
So, this part assumes that you‚Äôve at least played around with flexbox a little or are familiar with its properties. If not, go learn about it [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/){:target="_blank"}, play around with it [here](http://codepen.io/enxaneta/pen/adLPwv){:target="_blank"}, or preorder a highly anticipated guide [there](https://gumroad.com/l/YdWw){:target="_blank"}.

There‚Äôs two main strategies of implementing a flex-based masonry layout and both come with caveats:
1. Use one main `flex-direction: column` container around all items that wraps
2. Use separate column containers to wrap items for an individual column

Let‚Äôs break out the code.

### One main column container

For that first strategy, your markup should closely resemble/be identical to the markup used in the multi-column layout method; the CSS for the `.masonry` container is where it gets funky.

{% highlight css %}
.masonry {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
  width: 100%;
  height: 800px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Where before, `.masonry` was used to control `column-count`, we‚Äôre now replacing that with flexbox column that wraps. The *key thing* to take away from that snippet of CSS though, is that *set height*. It can be `100vh` or a pixel-based height, but it *must be set*. Without it, your columns will never wrap.

{% highlight css %}
.item {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 10px;
}

.item__content {
    background: purple;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The child elements, `.item`  and `.item-content` will be styled the same way as with the multi-column layout method, but without a need for `break-inside: avoid` on the `.item` class. 

With this flexbox method, it‚Äôs possible to make your layout responsive by adding media queries on the `.masonry` container. You would have to manually adjust the height at each viewport size to allow for appropriate wrapping to occur for the number of columns you desire.

{% highlight css %}
.masonry {
  height: auto;
}
  
@media screen and (min-width: 400px) {
  .masonry {
    height: 1600px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  .masonry {
    height: 1300px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
  .masonry {
    height: 1100px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1100px) {
  .masonry {
    height: 800px;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can see an example of this here:

<p data-height="354" data-theme-id="28441" data-slug-hash="KWyJoa" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ramenhog" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Responsive Pure CSS Masonry Layout - Flexbox" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/ramenhog/pen/KWyJoa/">Responsive Pure CSS Masonry Layout - Flexbox</a> by Stephanie (<a href="http://codepen.io/ramenhog">@ramenhog</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Obviously, attempting to dynamically determine the height in order to appropriately wrap your columns is not the most effective strategy, especially when it comes to responsiveness. So let‚Äôs see what strategy #2 has to offer us.

### Separate column containers

This method requires you to change your markup so you have a bit more control of what goes in each column, instead of relying on set heights. Your markup would look something like this for a three-column masonry layout.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="masonry">
  <div class="column">
    <div class="item">
      <div class="item__content">
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- more items -->
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div class="item">
      <div class="item__content">
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- more items -->
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div class="item">
      <div class="item__content">
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- more items -->
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, both the `.masonry` and `.column` containers need to be set with a `display: flex`:

{% highlight css %}
.masonry {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.column {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: calc(100%/3);
}
{% endhighlight %}

While you have a little more control over how the columns are laid out, obviously, it still takes some initial planning in figuring out how to structure your markup. And, it would be a lot more difficult to scale if you were to add other items to your masonry grid. 

And the only responsiveness you could add to this layout would be to change it from several columns to being one column on mobile:

{% highlight css %}
.masonry {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 500px) {
  .masonry {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}

.column {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
  width: 100%;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 500px) {
  .column {
    width: calc(100%/5);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## All in All
While flexbox implementations of the masonry layout can be achieved, they require a lot more forethought, aren‚Äôt desirable for scaling, and are simply rather hacky. For a pure CSS solution, the multi-column method wins out pretty fairly and squarely. 

However, it is still not perfect. It will fall short when you have to support browsers that don‚Äôt offer complete support of the CSS multi-column layout. Or even when you want the items in your grid to be sortable, instead of hardcoded in order. For those situation, you will still have to resort to a fallback in the form of a [JavaScript solution](http://masonry.desandro.com/){:target="_blank"}.

So, phew, long post, but those are my experiences with pure CSS masonry layouts. I would love to hear about your experiences, thoughts, critiques, and/or questions!
