description: Welcome AKA why I'm starting a blog.
---

First things first.  I won’t lie. Writing, for me, does not come easily. I will also admit that since graduating college, I’ve avoided most opportunities to put my thoughts into comprehensible words on paper, preferring to resort to emojis in Slack or just code in Sublime.

So why am I starting this blog, you might ask? 

Well, ever since I decided to turn away from my Bio degree and a possible future in medicine to pursue a career in web development about 3 years ago, one of the things that helped me mature the most as a dev was reading blog posts. I’ve grown so much from the posts detailing other people’s experimentation in code: things they’ve learned, things they’ve pondered, and just things they’ve wanted to share, hoping it would help someone else out there.  That’s what makes this community so amazing to be a part of.

And I know that I’m constantly learning something new in this fast-moving world of front-end; it’s one of my favorite parts of being a developer. So I can only hope, if I put some of my own experiences in this blog, maybe it can help another developer, start a conversation, or just serve as that randomly interesting read by someone else out there in the galaxy. Fingers crossed!

No promises I won’t get side tracked by other ramblings or cute videos of hedgehogs.

I mean, after all, I’m only human.
